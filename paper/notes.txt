Point of the paper:
To assess the practical impact of a set of parameters commonly used in LCMV and DICS beamforming.

Goals:
 - Our results should straightforwardly translate into concrete recommendations.
 - No "it depends", we should be able to say what exactly it depends on.
 - If a parameter performs bad in our tests, we should be comfortable removing it from the MNE API.

Parameters:
 - Regularization
 - Reduce rank
 - Orientation picking (pool, normal, max-power, vector)
 - Weight normalization (unit-noise-gain, nai, none)
 - Depth weighting
 - Leadfield normalization
 - Vector vs Scalar beamformer (single, matrix)
 - For DICS: real values only
 - Sensor type (grad/mag/combined)
 - Noise covariance whitening (implemented in this PR: https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/pull/7021)

Tests:
 - Simulation
   Sources all over the cortex. Not exactly on grid points! Avoid forward model "crime": add localization error
 - Real data    
   1. Head cast data with median nerve stimulation. One subject. Around 300 trials.
   2. MNE-Python somato dataset as publically available data set

Metrics:
 - Localization accuracy
 - Point Spread (Fancy Method (tm))
 - Output SNR (crosstalk?) Compare reconstructed timecourse against true simulated timecourse. Compute SNR.
 - Move two sources together (different, orthogonal time courses at each source), evaluate signal correlation at each distance: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0157655 - page 16

Tasks:
1) Finish data analysis
- Britta: real data analysis (data from Aarhus + MNE-Python sample data) (in progress - find MRI :/  )
- Marijn: MNE-Python somato dataset (publically available). Ask Lauri for raw data. On volume space.
- Chris+Marijn: Update "grid-search" script that runs beamformer with all parameters and runs evaluation metrics
- Marijn: put whitening somato example code on a GitHub PR
- Marijn: get simulation code to run on Triton cluster
- Marijn & Britta: get median nerve stimulation motor cortex activation point identified by experts.
    
2) Get figures
- Marijn: make web-interface to browse through results
- Britta: make comparable figures for the real data results, merging headcast and somato results

3) Writing
- Everyone!

Meetings:
- Tuesday, 5th Nov, 9:00 CPH and 10:00 HEL time
- Monday, 11th Nov, same time 
- Monday, 25th Nov, same time

Done tasks:

- Chris: Update simulation code (generate sources exactly on gridpoints, use different forward model for simulation and source localization). Done!
- Britta has done a manual co-registration on mne-sample in order to create a new. -trans file. Compute difference with original trans file. Error should be in the order of 5mm (coregistration error). Done!
- Everyone: Implement performance metrics: get ideas from:
